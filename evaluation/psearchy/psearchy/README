Derived from a sequential version of searchy (Jinyang Li's search engine)

mkdb.conf is as in searchy

Create directories to store the per-core dbs and files.  You may want to mount store each directory on a separately mounted file system.

   mkdir /tmp/db/db0
   mkdir /tmp/db/db1
   ....

To build the indices using two cores (-c 2) with a 1024 MB hash table per core (-m 1024), run:

   ./mkdb/pedsort -t /tmp/db/db -c 2 -m 1024 < files

To run the process version instead of the threaded version run:

   ./mkdb/pedsort -p -t /tmp/db/db -c 2 -m 1024 < files

To run the process version and round-robin assign processes to sockets/core run:

   ./mkdb/pedsort -p -t /tmp/db/db -c 2 -m 1024 -s 1 < files

Files should contain a pathname for a file to be indexed per line.


To query the indices:

   ./query/qe -t /tmp/db/db -q "main" -c 2  -l

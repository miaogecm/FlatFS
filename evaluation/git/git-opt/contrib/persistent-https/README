git-remote-persistent-https

The git-remote-persistent-https binary speeds up SSL operations
by running a daemon job (git-remote-persistent-https--proxy) that
keeps a connection open to a server.


PRE-BUILT BINARIES

Darwin amd64:
https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-remote-persistent-https/darwin_amd64.tar.gz

Linux amd64:
https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-remote-persistent-https/linux_amd64.tar.gz


INSTALLING

Move all of the git-remote-persistent-http* binaries to a directory
in PATH.


USAGE

HTTPS requests can be delegated to the proxy by using the
"persistent-https" scheme, e.g.

git clone persistent-https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git

Likewise, .gitconfig can be updated as follows to rewrite https urls
to use persistent-https:

[url "persistent-https"]
	insteadof = https
[url "persistent-http"]
	insteadof = http

LOCATION

The source is available in the contrib/persistent-https directory of
the Git source repository. The Git source repository is available at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git


PREREQUISITES

The code is written in Go (http://golang.org/) and the Go compiler is
required. Currently, the compiler must be built and installed from tip
of source, in order to include a fix in the reverse http proxy:

BUILDING

Run "make" to build the binaries. See the section on
INSTALLING above.

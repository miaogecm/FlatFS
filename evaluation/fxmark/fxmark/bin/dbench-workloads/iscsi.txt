# READ10/WRITE10 take an LBA and a XFERLEN arguments.
# These can be absolute numbers,
# but also as a simple expression for generation of random I/O
#
# These are strings starting with a '*' followed by one or more
# qualifiers :
# '*'    : Random 64 bit integer
# '/yyy' : align the number to yyy. This is the same as x = (x/y)*y
# '%yyy' : modulo yyy. This is the same as x = x%y
# '+yyy' : Add y
#
# Examples :
# '*'           A random value between 0 and 2**64-1
# '*/8'         A random value aligned to a page boundary (8blocks)
# '*/8%5000000' A random value between 0 and 500000 aligned by 8.
#
# '*%100+25'    A random value between 25 and 124

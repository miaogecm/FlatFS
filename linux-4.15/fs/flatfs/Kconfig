	   If your system has a block of fast (comparable in access speed to
	   system memory) and non-volatile byte-addressable memory and you wish to
	   mount a light-weight, full-featured, and space-efficient filesystem over
	   it, say Y here.

	   To compile this as a module,  choose M here: the module will be
	   called flatfs.
